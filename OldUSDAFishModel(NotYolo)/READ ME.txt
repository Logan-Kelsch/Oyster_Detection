In this group of files, you will find several documents including:
- TRileyModel.py
- TRileyUpdate.py
- TunerCallbacks.py
- NewModel.py
- CNN_Project_Final_Report.pdf

The images of fish used in these programs come from the Fish4Knowledge database, downloadable at https://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/f4k/. The 
images of oysters comes from a Google Drive collection downloadable at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JUYW5CqWgjxN2IryiWtTy5xU

Note: For all of the following programs, the file directories need to be updated for your particular machine. The datasets need to be 
downloaded from the resources above, and placed into directories according to the programs requirements.

- TRileyModel.py

This program is the copied version of Timothy Riley's fish classification CNN he made for his machine learning class at UMES. This was
a starting platform as I was introduced to the concept. The directories for this program separate the training images and testing images by species (10 total directories, 5 training
for 5 species, and 5 testing for 5 species).

- TRileyUpdate.py

This program is similar in content to the TRileyModel.py, however the way the program builds the CNN has been changed from a single 
declaration to a build_model function using the .add function. The directories for this program separate the training images and testing images by species (10 total directories, 5 training
for 5 species, and 5 testing for 5 species).

- TunerCallbacks.py

This program is the first fundamental piece to my research. This focuses on optimizing Timothy Riley's CNN model using Keras Callbacks
and Keras Tuner. These libraries allow the user to put in values for the program to test and improve the readability during the training
process. The directories for this program separate the training images and testing images by species (10 total directories, 5 training
for 5 species, and 5 testing for 5 species).

- NewModel.py

This program was the second fundamental piece to my research. This focuses on building a new model capable of making a binary decision
between fish and shellfish. The directories for this program uses two different directories. In each directory, each image type is 
separate. For example, there are two starting directories /train_set and /test_set. In each of those directories, there are more direc
tories, in this case /fish and /shellfish.

-CNN_Project_Final_Report.pdf

This file is the final research paper for this project, containing the results and conclusions to be made from those results.

Additional Notes:

- The files can be downloaded onto any linux machine or Python3 capable machine. The files were edited in vim, however there are many 
other text editors that this will work with.

- The configuration should be straight forward, the main consideration is making sure the directories are correct for your machine.

Known Bugs:

- Each of the above models have a problem with overfitting, meaning the validation set performs better than the training set.

- In some of the models (TRileyModel.py), the visual display of the models accuracy might have a fish image as the background. Make sure
that the plots background is cleared if this is a problem.

- In the NewModel.py file, the history = model1.fit() method has a bug with it's parameters. Edit this if you wish to run it.
